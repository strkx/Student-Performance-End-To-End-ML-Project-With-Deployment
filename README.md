## Features

*   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares student-related data for model training.
*   **Model Training:** Implements and trains a machine learning model to predict student performance.
*   **Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics.
*   **Deployment:** Includes resources for deploying the model to a cloud platform (Azure).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Sets up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS for automated builds, testing, and deployment.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/strkx/Student-Performance-End-To-End-ML-Project-With-Deployment.git
    cd Student-Performance-End-To-End-ML-Project-With-Deployment
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements.txt file exists
    # OR
    # Manually install the dependencies (see Dependencies section below)
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py # Example command, adjust as necessary
    ```

    Or execute relevant scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation separately.

2.  Follow the deployment instructions in the `Student-Performance-Azure-deployment-main.zip` or related deployment resources.

## Dependencies

*   **Python:** (version X.X or higher - *infer version from code if available*)
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model training and evaluation.
*   **Other Libraries:**  (*List other major libraries based on project structure and potential `requirements.txt` contents if available, e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, Flask, etc.*)
